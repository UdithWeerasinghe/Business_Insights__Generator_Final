3. **Monthly Trends**: The data reveals some interesting monthly trends:
   - May sales tend to be higher than April (69.30 vs. 130.53).

4. **Historical Data Analysis**: By examining historical data from previous years, you can identify patterns that may not be immediately apparent from a single year's forecast.

Recommendation: Analyze past sales trends to identify potential seasonal patterns or anomalies in demand. This will help you make more informed decisions about production, inventory management, and marketing strategies.
