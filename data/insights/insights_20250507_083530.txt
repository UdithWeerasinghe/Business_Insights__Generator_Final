Thank you for sharing the forecasting data of Chang. Based on the trends and patterns observed in the data, here are some actionable insights, recommendations, and suggestions:

**Insights:**

1. **Seasonal fluctuations**: The forecast shows significant seasonal fluctuations, with a peak in August (2018) and another peak in April (2019). This suggests that Chang's business is heavily influenced by seasonal demand.
2. **Year-over-year trends**: Comparing the data from 2018 to 2019, there is a noticeable decline in usage until January 2019, followed by an increase. This could indicate a correction period after a significant surge in previous years.
3. **Monthly variability**: The forecast reveals high variability within each month, suggesting that Chang's business may be experiencing some level of unpredictability or volatility.

**Recommendations:**

1. **Review and adjust seasonal strategies**: Consider adjusting your seasonal strategies to better align with the changing demand patterns observed in the data. This could involve reviewing inventory management, production planning, and distribution channels.
2. **Monitor and address decline**: The significant decline in usage until January 2019 may indicate a correction period after a surge in previous years. Keep a close eye on the business's performance during this time and consider implementing measures to stabilize demand.
3. **Invest in supply chain optimization**: Given the high variability within each month, it's essential to optimize your supply chain to ensure that you can respond quickly to changes in demand. Consider investing in technologies like predictive analytics or real-time monitoring to improve your supply chain's agility.
4. **Analyze and address underlying trends**: Look for underlying trends or factors driving the seasonal fluctuations and adjust your business strategy accordingly.

**Suggestions:**

1. **Quarterly review**: Schedule a quarterly review of your business's performance to assess progress, identify areas for improvement, and make data-driven decisions.
2. **Data analysis tools**: Invest in data analysis tools that can help you better understand Chang's business patterns and identify trends that might not be immediately apparent from historical data alone.
3. **Stakeholder engagement**: Engage with stakeholders, including customers, suppliers, and partners, to gain a deeper understanding of their expectations and concerns, which may inform your strategic decisions.
4. **Business continuity planning**: Develop a business continuity plan that outlines strategies for managing disruptions, such as natural disasters or supply chain issues, to ensure the long-term sustainability of Chang's business.
