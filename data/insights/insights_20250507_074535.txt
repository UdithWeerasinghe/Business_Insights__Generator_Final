b. **Inventory Management:** Ensure adequate inventory levels for peak demand periods to avoid stockouts and maximize sales.

c. **Product Expansion:** Consider introducing new products or variations during slower periods (e.g., January-February) to stimulate growth and drive sales.

d. **Sales Promotions:** Develop loyalty programs, discounts, or limited-time offers for loyal customers or specific demographics to increase sales during off-peak months.

6. **Suggestions:**

a. Conduct more in-depth market research to better understand customer preferences and behaviors.

b. Analyze competitor data to identify gaps and opportunities for differentiation.

c. Monitor consumer sentiment and adjust marketing strategies accordingly.
